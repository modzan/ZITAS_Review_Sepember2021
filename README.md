# ZITAS_Review_Sepember2021
ZANZIBAR INTEGRATED TAX ADMINSTRATION SYSTEM
In this project we will prepare a proposal for revision of the local tax administration system in Zanzibar
We aim to study and review the existing Tax systems in place
We will try to analyze all the taxes applicable laws and use them as the source of review for this purpose
it seems that the best way will be to do a versioning control to approach this review purpose
